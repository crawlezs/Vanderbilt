TITLE: moderated mediation analysis of play-2-cope data, based on PROCESS model 74
DATA: FILE IS model3.dat;
VARIABLE: NAMES ARE pftrait EWB Stress PHChng COVID_Out COVID_RS NegPM SocialSupport Resilience Lone_Isolation;

DEFINE: 
   XM = pftrait * COVID_Out;
 
ANALYSIS:
   TYPE = GENERAL;
   ESTIMATOR = ML;
   BOOTSTRAP = 10000;
! In model statement name each path using parentheses
MODEL:
   EWB ON COVID_Out (b1);
   EWB ON pftrait (cdash1);   ! direct effect of X on Y
   EWB ON XM (cdash2);
   [COVID_Out] (a0);
   COVID_Out ON pftrait (a1);
! Use model constraint to calculate indirect effect
MODEL CONSTRAINT:
   NEW(LOW_X MED_X HIGH_X IND_LOWX IND_MEDX IND_HIX);
	LOW_X = #2.3;   ! chosen low value of X: -2SD
	MED_X = #3.9;   ! chosen medium value of X: mean
	HIGH_X = #5.5;   ! chosen high value of X: +2SD
	
! Calc conditional indirect effects of X on Y via M for low, medium, high values of X
	IND_LOWX = a1*b1 + a1*cdash2*LOW_X;
	IND_MEDX = a1*b1 + a1*cdash2*MED_X;
	IND_HIX = a1*b1 + a1*cdash2*HIGH_X;
	
! Use loop plot to plot conditional indirect effect of X on Y
! NOTE - values of 1,5 in LOOP() statement need to be replaced by
! logical min and max limits of predictor X used in analysis
	PLOT(INDX);
	LOOP(XVAL,1,5,0.1);
	INDX = (a1*b1 + a1*cdash2*XVAL)*XVAL;
PLOT:
   TYPE = plot2;
OUTPUT:
   STAND CINT(bcbootstrap);
