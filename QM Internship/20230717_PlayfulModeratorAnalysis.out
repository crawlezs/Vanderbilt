INPUT INSTRUCTIONS

  !! Code from Stride et al (2015)

  ! Predictor variable - X
  ! Mediator variable(s) ï¿½ M
  ! Moderator variable(s) - (X)
  ! Outcome variable - Y

  TITLE: moderated mediation analysis of play-2-cope data, based on PROCESS model 74
  DATA: FILE IS model3.dat;
  VARIABLE: NAMES ARE pftrait EWB Stress PHChng COVID_Out COVID_RS NegPM SocialSupport Resil

  DEFINE:
     XM = pftrait * COVID_Out;

  ANALYSIS:
     TYPE = GENERAL;
     ESTIMATOR = ML;
     BOOTSTRAP = 10000;
  ! In model statement name each path using parentheses
  MODEL:
     EWB ON COVID_Out (b1);
     EWB ON pftrait (cdash1);   ! direct effect of X on Y
     EWB ON XM (cdash2);
     [COVID_Out] (a0);
     COVID_Out ON pftrait (a1);
  ! Use model constraint to calculate indirect effect
  MODEL CONSTRAINT:
     NEW(LOW_X MED_X HIGH_X IND_LOWX IND_MEDX IND_HIX);
  	LOW_X = #2.3;   ! chosen low value of X: -2SD
  	MED_X = #3.9;   ! chosen medium value of X: mean
  	HIGH_X = #5.5;   ! chosen high value of X: +2SD
  	
  ! Calc conditional indirect effects of X on Y via M for low, medium, high values of X
  	IND_LOWX = a1*b1 + a1*cdash2*LOW_X;
  	IND_MEDX = a1*b1 + a1*cdash2*MED_X;
  	IND_HIX = a1*b1 + a1*cdash2*HIGH_X;
  	
  ! Use loop plot to plot conditional indirect effect of X on Y
  ! NOTE - values of 1,5 in LOOP() statement need to be replaced by
  ! logical min and max limits of predictor X used in analysis
  	PLOT(INDX);
  	LOOP(XVAL,1,5,0.1);
  	INDX = (a1*b1 + a1*cdash2*XVAL)*XVAL;
  PLOT:
     TYPE = plot2;
  OUTPUT:
     STAND CINT(bcbootstrap);
